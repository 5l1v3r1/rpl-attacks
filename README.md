RPL Attacks Framework
=====================

This project is aimed to provide a simple and convenient way to generate simulations and deploy malicious motes for a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that uses Routing Protocol for Low-power and lossy devices (RPL) as its network layer. With this framework, it is possible to easily define campaign of simulations either redefining RPL configuration constants or using an own external RPL library.


Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository

 ```
 git clone ...
 ```

2. Install system requirements

 ```
 sudo apt-get install gcc-msp430 libcairo2-dev libffi-dev
 ```

3. Install Python requirements

 ```
 sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 or

 ```
 sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

4. Setup Cooja

 ```
 ../rpl-attacks$ fab setup
 ```

5. [Facultative] Create a default configuration file (see next section for details about this file)

 ```
 ../rpl-attacks$ fab config
 ```

or create a configuration file with your own parameters (respectively, *contiki_folder* and *experiments_folder*)

 ```
 ../rpl-attacks$ fab config:/opt/contiki,~/simulations
 ```


Configuration
-------------

Parameters :

- `contiki_folder`: the path to your contiki installation

>  [default: ~/contiki]

- `experiments_fodler`: the path to your experiments folder

>  [default: ~/Experiments]

These parameters can be tuned by editing ``~/.rpl-attacks.conf``. These are written in a section named "RPL Attacks Framework Configuration".

Example configuration file :

```
[RPL Attacks Framework Configuration]
contiki_folder = /opt/contiki
experiments_folder = ~/simulations
```


Commands
--------

Commands are used by typing ``fab:...``

- **`clean`**`:name`

> This will clean the simulation directory named 'name'.

- **`cooja`**`:name[, with-malicious-mote]`

> This will open Cooja and load simulation named 'name' in its version with or without the malicious mote.
>
>  `with-malicious-mote`: flag for starting the simulation with/without the malicious mote [default: false]

- **`launch`**`:name`

> This will start simulation in Cooja in hidden-GUI mode.

- **`make`**`:name[, make-target, external-rpl-library]`

> This will build all firmwares from ``root.c``, ``sensor.c`` and ``malicious.c`` templates with the specified target mote type. This can alternatively make the malicious mote with an external library by providing its path.

- **`new`**`:name[, number-of-nodes,
                      malicious-mote-type,
                      malicious-mote-config-constants,
                      simulation-duration,
                      simulation-title,
                      simulation-goal,
                      simulation-notes,
                      simulation-debug-mode]`

> This will create a simulation named 'name' with specified parameters.
> 
>  `malicious-mote-type`: root/sensor [default: sensor]
>  `malicious-mote-confic-constants`: every constant configurable in ContikiRPL implementation (e.g. `RPL_CONF_MIN_HOPRANKINC`), formatted as a dictionary [default: none]
> 
>  `simulation-duration`: in seconds [default: 300]
>  `simulation-title`, `simulation-goal`, `simulation-notes`: customized simulation-specific information for the Cooja simulation [default: none]
>  `simulation-debug-mode`: boolean [default: false]

- **`parse`**`:name`

> This will parse log files generated by Cooja to retrieve exchanged messages, power tracking measures, ...

- **`plot`**`:name`

> This will generate plots from parsed results.

- **`make_all`**`:simulation-campaign-json-file`

> This will generate a campaign of simulations from a JSON file formatted and execute the chain `clean`|`new`|`make` for each simulation. See ``./templates/experiments.json`` for simulation campaign JSON format.

- **`run_all`**`:simulation-campaign-json-file`

> This will generate a campaign of simulations from a JSON file formatted and execute the chain `clean`|`new`|`make`|`launch`|`parse`|`plot` for each simulation. See ``./templates/experiments.json`` for simulation campaign JSON format.


Simulation campaign
-------------------

Example JSON :

```
{
  "sinkhole": {
    "simulation": {
      "title": "Sinkhole Attack",
      "goal": "Show that the malicious node is creating another\n DODAG, preventing some motes from joining legitimate\n root's DODAG",
      "notes": "The malicious mote will use the same prefix as the\n root and prevent sensors from joining the legitimate\n DODAG",
      "number_motes": 10,
      "target": "z1",
      "duration": 120,
      "debug": true
    },
    "malicious": {
      "type": "sensor",
      "constants": {
        "RPL_CONF_MIN_HOPRANKINC": 128
      }
    }
  }
}
```
