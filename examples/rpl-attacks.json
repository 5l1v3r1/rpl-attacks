The reason is that upon the reception of a DIS, the nodes reset immediately send a DIO, due to the multicast nature of the sent DIS.<br><br><b>Variant of the attack</b>: Another way of performing a flooding attack can be to unicast DIS to the neighbors, immediately triggering a DIO in response but not the trickle timer reset.
